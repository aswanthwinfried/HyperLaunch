8. Define block scope and function scope. Which JavaScript keywords
 (var, let, or const) are associated with each type of scope ?

 Block Scope: Refers to the scope of a variable within a block of code, enclosed in curly braces {}. Variables declared with let and 
 const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.
 Example: 
    if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
}
console.log(x);


 Function Scope: Refers to the scope of variables within a function. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they 
 are accessible anywhere inside the function, regardless of block structures.
 Example:
 function myFunc() {
    var y = 20;
    if (true) {
        var y = 30;  
        console.log(y); // 30
    }
    console.log(y); // 30
}
myFunc();
